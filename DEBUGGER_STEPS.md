# Debugger Steps Analysis

## Breakpoint 1: Capturing Form Data Before Validation
- **Explanation**: This breakpoint occurs right after the form is submitted, but before validation begins. It allows us to inspect the user input data.
- **What changed after stepping through**: After stepping through the code, I confirmed that the form data was correctly captured. The `name` and `email` variables had the expected values, and no errors had occurred yet.
  
## Breakpoint 2: Email Validation
- **Explanation**: This breakpoint is placed after the email validation rule is applied. The program checks if the email input matches the required regex pattern.
- **What changed after stepping through**: Upon stepping through, I observed that the program correctly validated the email format, but I noticed that the error message was not triggered when the email format was incorrect (the issue was traced to a missing `aria-describedby` attribute).

## Critical State Analysis: Error Handling for Invalid Email
- **Analysis**: At this state, the program correctly detected an invalid email format but failed to display an error message due to a missing link between the `input` field and the error message element. This affected the user's ability to see what was wrong with their input.
- **Expected Behavior**: The program should display an error message adjacent to the email input field. The next step should involve fixing the missing `aria-describedby` link to ensure the error message is announced to screen readers.
